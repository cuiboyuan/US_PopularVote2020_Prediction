# U.S. 2020 Presidential Election Popular Vote Prediction

## Introduction

This is a statistical report on predicting the popular vote in U.S. 2020 election for each candidate. We employ the post-stratification technique and incorporate variable age, gender, state, race, education, and income into our analysis.

In addition to popular vote, we also analyze the popular vote proportion for each state by post-stratification.
